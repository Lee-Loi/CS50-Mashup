# CS50-Mashup
A website that loads in a SQL database of USA postcodes and overlays the Google Maps API with markers of post codes. Upon clicking, view news articles and weather information local to the post code

Will require mySQL for website to read post codes.

Most of the action and my implementation takes place in the scripts.js file. However the command line PHP script that loads 25000+ post codes into an SQL database is also worth checking out in the import folder.

(Using open weather information requires browsers like Chrome to load unsafe scripts, info window may not work until you do. Advice is to either remove implementation or pay for the secure version)

You will need to get a free API key from openweathermap.org and enter it in at line 243.
